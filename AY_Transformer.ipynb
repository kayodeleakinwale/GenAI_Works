Recent US intelligence reports say that Israel is seeking to capitalize on the destruction inflicted after it bombed Iran’s missile production facilities and air defenses in October. And overall, Israel is also still pursuing the broader goal of causing regime change in Iran, one such intelligence report said. Israel sees Iran as an existential threat: For years, Israel has said it has the most to lose if Iran, which refuses to recognize Israel’s right to exist, develops a nuclear bomb. Israel and Iran have been fighting a shadow war through proxies and covert actions for decades. Tehran has supported regional armed groups that have engaged in direct conflict with Israel, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, and the Houthis in Yemen. Since Israel’s war in Gaza began, attacks by Iran-backed proxy groups have escalated in solidarity with the Palestinians. Netanyahu is in hot water domestically: Opposition to a new military conscription bill has sparked political deadlock, and Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, had met for talks about dissolving itself – which could have ultimately led to early elections that polls show Netanyahu would lose.\"\n",
